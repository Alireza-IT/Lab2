# Stories and personas
User 1 : Andy is a university student. the distance from his university to his house is far so he rented a car. Spending money for fuel is important to him because he does not earn so much money from his part time job. 

User 2 : Jessica is a teacher , she has 3 children. Every mornings she prepares children for going to school with her. It usually takes time to make her children ready for school so she prefers to choose the nearest Gas station for her car's fuel.

User3 : Stephen has graduated from university recently and he has started his job a month later. He got loan and bought a new car for reaching his office. the price of fuel is important for him because he has a few savings and he pays more than 50 percents of his salary each month for the loan. 
He works also in nights and he has usually some problems for waking up in the morning so he does not have enough time to go to the cheapest Gas station. He wants a Gas station which is in his path from his house to his office also he wants to know the price of those stations to make a better decision.
