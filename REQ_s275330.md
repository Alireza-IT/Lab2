# Stories and personas
Mina has been working for many years in Esfahan as a taxi driver. She works around 10 hours a day in the city and also she is an independent driver. Therefore, she does not have a specific route plane for driving and she can be everywhere in the city to serve the customers. Thus, her location in the city is dependent on the customer's rout. She uses the EZGas application on her smartphone to find the nearest and cheapest gas station. Mina believes that the application is a mandatory part of her job and without this, she will waste lots of time and money.

Reza is a new gas station owner. He is a gadget lover and tries to be an up to date person in technologies. Therefore, he wants to connect his business to new methods. He likes to use the EZGaz application to update the price of fuel because this is more convenient to inform the user new price by the app rather than any other way. Besides, due to the unforeseen circumstances in the station like maintenance of the fuel tanks, he can inform his lovely customers by the state of the station. Sometimes it will be closed for many hours in a week. Now, he can handle his responsibilities better than ever.

Shima works for a firm that develops many applications for transportation companies. Recently, her manager asks her to be an administrator of EZGas application due to her remarkable experiences in this field. She now, should manage and helps the users if they can't log in or in case of any other issues. Besides, she should publish the news about the new updates and new features of the application.
