# Abstract

Some *customers* volunteer to report prices of fuels in different gas stations where they transit when they refuel.  
Customers can be registered and unregistered 

For gas stations for which no data is collected during the last 24 hours the reporting activity may be carried out by *empoyees* of the Gas station itself by sending them a notification. 
To report the data to the administrator customers and employees can both use a telegram channel/ mail which can be found on the site of the crowdsourcing company.

One *administrator* of the crowdsourcing EZGas service is collecting and joining all these data in an excel sheet. Possibly as the number of gas stations to manage increases the number of administrators may increase as well in order to efficiently manage  the service over time.
In the same excel sheet together with fuel prices are collected the loactions of the Gas stations.

# Stories and personas
Mike volunteers to keep track of the prices of fuel of gas stations in an area. Every time Mike has to refuel his vehicle he can send data of the gas station in which he decided to refuel to the application. Notice that Mike can give informations to the application about  both diesel fuel price and gas price or just about one of them. In order to send data to the application Mike has to perform the logi to the appliction. Once Mike's data arrive to the application, values for that gas station are updated. Everytime time Mike has to refuel his vehicle, he can check on the application which is the cheapest and nearest station around him.

Mary works in the gas station, it is in her interest to have the values of her gas station updated each day. So if none of the customers of that gas station provide fuel price informations for more then 24 houres a notification is sent to Mery to infor her that in order to have updated price values in the application she has to provice them.
