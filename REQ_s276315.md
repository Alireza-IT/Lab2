# Abstract

The EZGas application is an application built to provide a crowdsourcing service that allows multiple users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and to locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice in that moment, allowing users to choose the more convenient station for them. 

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Users             |They look at the map and can insert new gas stations or update prices if they see any changes| 
| Administrator     |Do not use directly the application, they check users changes in the map, and fix errors and inconsistences| 
| Maps provider     | An already deployed map application which provides graphic maps and geolocation to each device. |

# Stories and personas
Paolo is an employee which each morning must go to the office with his car, and in the evening has to come back home. Due to office distance from his home, he travels a lot of kilometres each day and spends a lot of money each month in gas for each car. He often refuels his car at the gas station near to his home. 
Paolo knows there are other gas station near his office or in the street from home to it, which sometimes have cheaper prices than his usual one, but he never has enough time to check their prices physically before refuelling: this will cost him too much time and a lot of fuel, avoiding any saving money possibility.
A lot of his colleagues have the same issue, so they usually share the information about the best prices during the coffee-break, helping each other saving money. 
He would like an app easily accessible from his smartphone that can provide him the position of the cheapest gas station without wasting time, with the possibility to update prices in a fast way in case of changes (which are frequent). He knows this goal is shared among other colleagues; therefore, he hopes other people will signal any price change

Luca, Paolo's colleague, likes receiving information about the cheaper gas station, but has a very bad memory: he never remembers how much he paid, so can't share any information with other colleagues. 

Giovanni, for working reason, often needs to travel a lot of kilometres, with his own car, on highways. He knows that highways gas station is never the cheapest choice but looking for a cheaper one in a new city that he doesn't know require too much time for him, so he always refuel in highways gas station.
