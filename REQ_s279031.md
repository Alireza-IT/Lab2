# Stories and personas
John is a delivery man, so he has to drive a lot every day in cities he does not know well. He uses its own vehicle so he has to pay for the fuel. He needs to save as much money as he can on the fuel expense, in order to earn a good salary every month. Even if he refuels every day, it can happen that he needs to get gas again in places he does not know. Therefore, he wants to rapidly find the nearest gas stations and compare the prices in order to find the cheapest one. Because he does not want to waste time he wants to find the directions for the chosen station directly in the same app, without having to switch to another mapp application and having to search again for the station.

Mark owns some gas stations and has a lot of tasks to do. Sometimes it can happen that he forgets to update the prices of the fuel in his stations on the application through his administrator account, so the actual fuel cost can be cheaper or more expensive than the one saved in the app. He would like that when this happens, a customer could send a request to replace the wrong prices with the correct ones, and that he could accept or reject the request.

Julia works as a doctor in a private clinic far from her home. The travel expenses are paid by the clinic administration that, every month, tops up a prepaid card. When Julia has to refuel, she wants to pay by card. Therefore she wants to use the app to locate the nearest gas stations and to know if she can pay by card.
