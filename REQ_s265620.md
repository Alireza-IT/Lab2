# Abstract
Car driver want to have a way to know what is the best price gas station in their surrounding while travelling in order to save money or what is the nearest one for getting fuel as quick as possible in case of need.
For meeting this need the EZgas mobile application will be developed. In this application there is a GoogleMaps interface that shows all the gas station in a default radius (that can be set to a different value by the user) with the relative price for the different kind of fuel.

Everytime the fuel price of a gas station change, an employee has to update the application with the new price. There could also be application without prices.

# Stakeholders

| Gas Station | Has the interest to 'advertise' itself as a competitive alternative |
| GPS system | Locates the driver |
| GoogleMaps | Show what is in the surrounding |
| DataBase   | Record all current prices for fuel |

# Stories and personas

Mr. Smith is driving to go to the sea. He has enough fuel to complete most of it's long trip, so it is possible for him to skip some gas station an waiting for the cheapest one. Hence he starts its EZgas application by tapping on the icon. He has no need to sets the parameters (gas and radius), nor to login as "car driver" role, since is not the first time he use the app. By a quick look to the screen he discover that the third station, as the bird fly, in the defined radius is the most convenient, so he decide to skip the first two along its route.

Mark is a freshman just hired in a big company after completing its studies as computer engineer. Being the first days he is a little nervous, so lately he forget to have a look to the fuel level indicator of is car. He is in a hurry but it's fuel is not at all sufficient to reach his new office. So he tap on the EZgas icon and set the radius parameter to the same value of the remaining kilometers he can travel, without caring about the price. Luckily, EZgas discover an appropriate station, and Mark won't be late.

Harry is the manager of a gas station. It's duty, among others, it's to update everymorining the price of the gas station he works for in the EZgas application. In order to do this he open the EZgas app, select the profile "gas station owner", and type the price in the apposite window of his gas station.
