# Abstract

Today there have been a great progress in every working area for all people using the benefits of IT systems. For example, drivers would want to know about the prices of gas in different stations and would like to know where each gas station is located so that they are able to choose the best price or the closest station among them.

Considering this situation, a group of developers decide to develop an application to support these drivers to fulfill their needs finding gas stations around and see the prices of each one. Moreover, that could help gas station owners to introduce their gas station to more customers. Gas stations owners update their information in the application. For example, they update the price for a specific fuel and drivers find about the price through this app. Drivers, also with the aid of GPS, can find all gas stations locations on a map.

# Stories and personas
Jim uses public transportation to go to work every morning. One day he misses the early bus and he comes to this result that it would be so late if he waited for the next bus to arrive. So, he decided to go back home to take his own car to go to work. Unfortunately, he finds out that he is out of gas and there’s no time to refill the car tank. Hopefully, he knew about the existence of an application which was called “EZGas” which could help him find the nearest gas station around. He knew that by using that application he would be able to know about the exact location of gas stations and the fuel prices. So, he finds a gas station in the route of his office and without wasting any time he was able to refill his car and get to the office on time.

On the other hand, Luigi is gas station owner. He spends too much time on his gas station, but he has a few customers. Since he does not expend much money to introduce his gas station to people around, his earning is low. His gas station was not in the main district of the city and not anybody was aware of existence of this gas station. Joe, one of his friends, introduces the “EZGas” application to him in which he can add his gas station to the list of all gas stations to show on the map for drivers. Also, he was able to insert the prices of fuels and possibly open/close hours. Now, he can count on having more customers in his gas station.
