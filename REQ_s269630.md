# Stories and personas
Link is the owner of a little country road petrol station that works aside his wife Zelda to refuel and to manage the tiny bar got together with the petrol pump. 
Link wants to extend the brand recognition of his asset but does not want to spend too much money. Moreover, he wants to enlarge his clientele since it is located in a little traffic street.

Kratos and his son Atreus own a gas station in the highway. Prices are quite high since highway billing but the station is equipped with many facilities: Internet access point, GPL pump, self-service restaurant, a mini market, a picnic area, showers and toilets. They would like to highlight their wide offer of services, emphasising the high quality of stay.

Sam Porter Bridges is a freelance carrier and in his life, moving is crucial. He is used to travel on route 34 every week and he knows every gas station location on the way. He wants to be notified while driving with gas companies daily prices in order to pick every time the cheapest place to refuel.

Poldo is always hungry and travelling for him is a torture. He would like to stay update for every gas station on the way equipped with a fast food or a restaurant.
