# Abstract

A group of students outside Turin are forced to use their cars in turn to move to the university.
Every day they are forced to do many kilometers and consume a lot of fuel. They are always on the hunt for a gas station to save as much time and money as possible. One of them takes care of keeping an eye on the prices but never manages to guarantee complete and up-to-date information.

One of them, that study computer engineer, had the brilliant idea to develop an application that can help them to save money and track prices based on the nearest gas station. This application is used by the administrators of the gas stations to promote their quality and prices to help drivers save money by moving as little as possible from their path.

# Stories and personas

Aldo is a very smart guy and has an inclination for order and organization. He is trying to get the master degree on Embedded systems and every day he has to take his car, or go with the car of other colleagues, and drive for 40 minutes to reach the university. Every day he organizes himself with his colleagues to decide who will use the machine in turn.
Every time he has to deal with paying a different fee with his colleagues, as they don't know a priori how much it will cost to refuel their car and for a student money are always a problem. His colleagues trust his advice, but every time they waste a lot of time getting organized.

Aldo is happy to do this work every day, but he also would like to have a simple way to organize with his colleagues all expenses and consumption for the fuel. Without his work nobody has a clear idea of which gas station is more convenient than another and how money they have to prepair before getting out in the morning.

Giovanni is the director of a service station. He has always put good prices on his fuels, but unfortunately his position is not very intuitive for those who do not drive on the highway. With the application, his business is skyrocketing. He is very grateful to aldo for having had the idea of ​​making this app and being able to help him.

Giacomo is a colleague of aldo, he loves to drive. Every turn or gear change is an 
emotion for him. of all colleagues, he is the one who always prefers to drive instead of 
being a passenger
