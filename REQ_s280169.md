# Abstract

Some drivers don't know where the gas stations are and the price of each type of fuel. So a group of university students want to develop an application which allows the drivers to find the best gas station when they are running out of gas. The gas station owners can add or remove their gas station in the map and they can update the prices.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Driver     |Uses the application to choose the gas station | 
| Gas Station Owner        |Use the application to add or remove the gas station and update the fuel prices |
| Map provider |The application uses the map to share locations | 
| Developer |Fixes bugs and develops the code for the application  |

# Stories and personas
Tom is on his way to go to the sea with his family: his husband Jhon and his son Dimitry. The fuel of Tom's car is running out and he needs to find a gas station on the road. Dimitry wants to help his father searching a cheap gas station on the road. Tom is going to the first gas station that he has found but Dimitry, checking the prices on the EZGas app, suggests to his father to go to the next gas station because it is cheaper. Tom drives until the gas station suggested and he fills the car saving some money. He is happy and he thanks Dimitry with an icecream bought in the gas station's bar.
Jhon is surprised and asks how Dimitry knew those prices. Dimitry shows the EZGas app to Jhon and Jhon recommends this app to his friend Gianni that has a gas station.
Gianni adds his gas station on the map and he gains a lot of new customers thanks to the app.
