# Stories and personas
John travels a lot. He is often not familiar with the territory he is in, hence he cannot know where to buy the cheapest fuel. He would also like to share his best discoveries of good prices during his journey since It's possible that some gas station will not be listed in the database the app relies on. John would also like to know if a gas station is opened at some time or it is not.

A gas station could be temporarly out of service.

Alberto is an administrator, he looks for lists of gas station and the prices they practice, interviews gas station owners, and verifies if some user reported a different price or a new gas station that was not in the database. He also reads complaints about the reliability of gas stations and in some case remove the ones run by inadempient owners for the sake of our beloved users. 

Obviously gas stations sell different kind of fuels, john's mom has an electric car, she wants to know where to charge it at best prices.

# System Design
It is likely we will need a map service to integrate. It runs on the most common web browsers. Coordinates are in longitude/latitude format. Differnt currencies are supported as well as different languages.
# Deployment Diagram
 The architecture is composed by server a clientAdmin and a ClientSideUser, the server rapresents the system accessed by both clientAdmin and clientUser. ClientSideUser and clientUser cannot communicate, they have to use the system if they want to exchange informations indirectly
