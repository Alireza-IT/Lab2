# Abstract

EZGas is a webapplication that gives the users the possibility to get different informations regarding the prices and locations of the gasstations inserted by other users. Being a crowdsourcing application it is up to the people using the appication to insert the gas stations and the prices regarding the different fuel types. Because of the frequent changes to the prices the users have the option to update the informations regarding the stations. The users have the possibility to order their search based on price, gas type and location.

# Stories and personas

John has to drive to an appointment by car but he is running low on gas. Since he is already late he needs a fuel
station that is as near as possible to his home. He uses the mobile versione of EZGas to look for all the fuel
stations around him and finds the closest one.

Tom uses the car very often so to save some money he prefers to find a ceaper fuel station even if it means
driving a little further. So when he uses EZGas he orders his search based on the prize of the fuel offered by
the different stations. But when he reaches the fuel station he had chosen he realizes that the prizes have been
increased. In order to inform the other users he immediatly goes on EZGas to update the fuel prizes.
On his mamy trips Tom also keeps an eye on possible new fuel stations. Whenever he finds a new one or simply one
that hasn't been inserted on EZGas yet, he tries to insert the new stations as soon as possible, even though
sometimes he isn't able to remeber the prizes. But another user may insert them later on.

Daniel has leased a new car that uses methane as a fuel. He doesn't know yet which fuel stations sell methane so he 
goes on EZGas to find the nearest one.

In this web application the users are called Driver which have to be registerd in order to use it. For the registration they have to choose a password and a username. Furthermore a they have to insert also the fiscal code, used by the application to univocally identify the drivers.
The application gives the drivers the possibility to perform two different operations:

**Gas station:**
A gas station is described by it's name address (saved as cordinates by the system) and opening hours, in addition to the fuel types that are offered.

**Search of one or more gas stations:**
The driver can change the gas station based on the location, gas type or the location of the gas station.

**Gas station management:**
This operation includes the insertion of a new gas station, the deletion or the modification of an existing gas station. In addition to the modification of the fuel prices the modification also includes the possibility to change further informations regarding the different stations.
