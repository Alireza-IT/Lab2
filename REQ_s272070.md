# Stories and personas
Mike loves to travel the country riding his truster motorbike. In doing so, he often finds himself ith an almost empty tank, and no knowledge of the nearby gas stations. He opens EZGas on his phone mounted on the bike and travels to the nearest gas station following the directions given by the app. He can also compare the different prices and chose the cheaper one, since traveling is an expensive hobby per se.
