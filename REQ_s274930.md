# Abstract

Consider the EZGas application:

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to: 

* collect prices of fuels in different gas stations;
* locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name          |                         Description                          |
| ------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| User                      | Can be registered (with login credentials) or not; optionally reports the prices of the gas station they visit. |
| Gas Station Owner/Manager | They may be aware of the existence of the application, they may decide to report prices to attract costumers. |
| App Platform | The platform on which the application will be distributed influces it with its rules and policies. |
| Map SDK | The kit used to integrate maps in the app. |

# Stories and personas

July would like to minimize costs related to refueling, she downloads the app and sign ups. She reports the prices of the station in front of her house when she remembers to do so. She tracks prices weekly to know when gas is cheaper.

Bob is a gas station owner, he uses EZGas to report prices everyday, in order to attract more customers. He has an account.
Mark is looking to save some money trying to do refueling in cheaper gas station. He doesn't want to waste time, he uses the app without authenticating and doesn't report prices.

```plantuml
left to right direction
actor User as a
a -- (FR1 Record that a new gas station is available)
a -- (FR2 Record the set of prices of a station on a certain day)
a -- (FR4 Spot the cheapest station in the neighbouring area)
a -- (FR5 Look at the last prices reported for a given gas station )
```

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Record that a new gas station is available

| Actors Involved  |                        Administrator                         |
| ---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Precondition     |             New station S opens, user U Exists           |
| Post condition   |               S is added to the Database                 |
| Nominal Scenario |U finds out about S, reports its position on the platform if not already present|

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Record the set of prices of a station on a certain day

| Actors Involved  |                        Administrator                         |
| ---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Precondition     |           Gas Station S is open, User U can see prices       |
| Post condition   |               Prices are recorded on the platform            |
| Nominal Scenario |               U is refueling, reports the prices             |
| Variants         |              U is the Manger of S, reports the prices        |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR4 Spot the cheapest station in the neighbouring area
