# Stories and personas
Mark loves to spend his holidays making long journeys by car and therefore he often needs to refuel his car in a gas station. It is important for him that the gas stations are as close as possible to his travel route so as not to make long detours. When it is time to refuel he opens the EZGas application and selects the fuel type of his car and the maximum distance within which he wants to find a station. All the stations near Mark are displayed on the map. He chooses the gas station with the lowest price and goes to refuel.

Andy has a wife and two young children. His family owns only one car which is used by him and his wife mainly to run errands around the city. Andy is in charge of refueling and every Sunday he goes to the usual gas station. Every time he notices that the price of the fuel has changed since the last time, he opens EZGas and updates the price on the application to let other users know about the change.
