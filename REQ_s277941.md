# Official Requirements Document

# Abstract
Ezgas allows people visiting a gas station to share pricing informations with other drivers. A person goes to a certain gas station, view and send to the application the current price of the fuel, allowing all the users to know the fuel price at that specific gas station. 
In this way if I am in a certain area and I would like to buy fuel, I can view from the application all the gas stations available in my nearbie area and go to the cheapest one.

# Stories and personas
Andrea is in San Nicandro Garganico and buys fuel at a certain gas station. After doing it, he opens the EzGas application in his smartphone and send the price that he had paid for that specific gas station.

Anna is at his home in the same city of Andrea. She would like to take her car in order to go to Maria and buy some pizzas. The problem is that she has little money and the fuel in her car is almost empty. So she, from her desktop pc, open the EzGas application, look for nearbie gas stations and luckly found the price that Andrea posted before. Looking at the price now Anna knows that she has the money for the fuel and for the pizzas, so she goes out to take them both.

Gaspare is at Turin. He would like to buy fuel for his car as cheap as possible because he is greedy. He turn on the EzGas application but, even if he is in a bigger city, here the application has not already been diffused so much, so he is not able to view any gas station in his nearbie area. Unsatisfied and sad, Gaspare will spend more money for fuel in respect to Anna and Andrea.
