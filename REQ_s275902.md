# Stories and personas
 
Josh is a family man, he has a precarious job. Every morning he wakes up early to go to work. He would like to use the bicycle to save the price of fuel, but unfortunately the company he works for is very far from his home. The gas station in which he is used to going has recently raised prices, despite being aware of this he does not know others stations where to go. He would like to have a simple way to find which gas station offers the fuel at a lower price.
 
Mark is a carefree boy. He works in the family business. He loves driving sports cars and recently bought one. His girlfriend lives several hundred kilometers away from him. Mark takes the car every weekend to get there and spend time with her. He would be interested in having an easy way to find out the nearest petrol station, whenever the petrol is running so as to stop only when necessary.
 
Luke is a manager of a company, he often travels with his company car. Since he does not pay for fuel directly, he is not so interested in the price of this. The trips he makes can be very long and he is therefore interested in finding welcoming rest areas that can offer him good coffee and good service.
 
Anna is a young girl who cares about the environment and is very worried about the increase of the pollution. She works in a company outside the city where she lives so she cannot use public transport to go to work and not even other green solutions. She would like to buy an electric car but her salary won't allow her. For this reason, she decided to buy a natural gas city car that consumes and pollutes little. Unfortunately, there are very few refueling stations that offer this fuel and reluctantly have to use petrol when facing longer journeys. She would like to find a way to find natural gas stations close to where she is and organize trips, being sure that she can always find this type of supply.
