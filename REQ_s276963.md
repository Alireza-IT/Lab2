# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations.
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.
- share this information between its users


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Driver    |Uses the application to retrieve information about gas station and possibly to add new ones| 
| Fuel station owner       |May or may not use the application, is interested in obtaining more customers to increase revenues| 
|Maps|Provides access to location services and maps|

# Stories and personas

Jane works as a lawyer in an office, and drives to her workplace every day. She and her husband also use the car to bring their children to school and for travelling. Up to now Jane has been refuelling at the first gas station she could find when the tank level was running low, sometimes asking passersby on the street.
She and her husband are always very busy and are not willing to waste time in looking for the cheapest gas station. Instead, they would welcome a system that helps in finding the closest one.    

Mark is a clerk, he lives alone and mostly uses the car to drive to the office. He is a very precise person and likes to keep track of his expenses. Sometimes Mark and his colleagues exchange suggestions and opinions about prices of different products, including gasoline.
He will from now on be able to use EZGas to find the best gas station in advance, and plan his drives consequently.

Richard owns a gas station, he sells different fuel types and offers several other services. He promotes its business using fidelity bonuses and flyering to get new customers. He will sign up to EZGas and use it as a new channel to reach his customers: he will update almost every day the page about his station and easily check his competitors' prices.
