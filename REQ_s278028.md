# Personas and stories

John is driving when he notices that his fuel's car is almost empy.<br>So John, takes his smartphone and he connects to the EZGas web application in order to choose the gas station with the lower fuel price in that area. We assume that John is already registered and logged in the application. John considers that the remaining fuels is enough to travel at most 8 km, so he changes the radius of the area to 8 km. In the main page of the application, John inserts the address in which he is located and the application shows all the gas stations close at most 8 km to him. 

Tim, a gas station owner, in order to obtain more clients than his rivals, decide to lower the prices of his gas station. <br>Tim is looking for a way to spread the news about his new offers to his clients. John, a friend of Tim, tell him about this new application that he uses to look for the best gas station in terms of prices and/or closeness. <br>Tim decides to try it and he sign in the application as owner of a gas station. During the log in, he insert same informations as the place where his gas station is located and his current fuel prices. After that, his gas station is visible to all the users that are using the app.
