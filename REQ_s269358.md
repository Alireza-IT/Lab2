# Abstract

In any city or place, people usually learn with experience or by word of mouth to find both the closest and cheapest gas station, according to their needs.

We could build an application that collects those informations from people, so that they can be provided to anyone and be updated constantly and efficiently.

# Stories and personas

Tom uses his car daily to commute, when he runs out of gas he goes to the cheapest gas station which is not too far from his home or work place. It happens from time to time, that he finds such gas station closed or with unusually high prices. When this happens, he wonders if he could have known the situation without physically going to the gas station wasting time and/or money.
This is even more annoying when Tom makes longer journeys, especially when using highways, since prices are higher there he would like to know when he may benefit to drive out of the highway to make gas, without getting lost or uselessly drive for more kilometres.

Tom then downloads EzGas, so just after he notices he's short on gas, takes out his smartphone and run the application. In the application he finds out the gas station that fullfils his needs (price, distance, services offered). Once he selects his preferred gas station, he gets all the driving directions to actually getting there.

It can happen from time to time, that the information listed on EzGas is wrong or partially wrong. If this doesn't happen to frequently Tom will understand the situation may consider to update the informations himself.
