# Abstract

Some drivers may want to know the prices and the positions of the gas stations near them.
Having this information, they can choose the best station among them. It is useful for managing their both fuel and pocket.
Knowing this, a group of developers may want to build an application which allows them to find the proper gas station that better fit in their necessities by concerning some parameters like position, maximum distance and prices, and the specific fuel type.
Gas station owners can update pieces of information about prices and positions to raise their chance to be chosen.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Drivers     |Uses the application to choose among fuel stations  (1000-10000 people)| 
| Gas Station Owners        |use the application to share their prices and options, letting drivers know them|
| Map provider        |use the services from to share locations of stations|
| Databse provider        |use the services from to share save information among users|

# Stories and personas
Alice usually wakes up late in the morning. She drinks a couple of coffee and goes out to prevent being fired from being late at work.
She has recently changed her house; as a result, she is no familiar with the local places.
Moreover, she is a very economical woman to save money and buy an electric car.
After being in her car, she found out he car almost runs out of the fuel. She was heard about a new application named EZGAS, which shows all gas stations and also sorts them by their prices. So she can easily download the app, turn on the gps, and using the internet to see all the near stations with their current prices.
Jerry is a young owner of a newly opened gas station. He is an update man, trying to use technology in all his life and work as much as possible.
He uses EZgas to let all drivers knew about his location and also low prices. A little description of his station is also included. Therefore he uses this application as an advertisement and makes his new station well-known.
Thanks to the EZGAS, Alice filled her car's fuel tank as fast as possible and did not get fired.
Jerry is also satisfied with raising a number of customers.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR5-7  Gas station owner update database

| Actors Involved        | Gas station owner |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Having a registerd gas station, have an internet connection, have a smartphone or a computer|  
|  Postcondition     | Gas station is parameters has updated in database |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The gas station information (location, kind of fuels supported, price, etc.) updated in database|
|  Variants     | The lower prices stations will promote in the application for drivers |
