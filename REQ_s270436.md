# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     |Manages fuel prices of different gas stations| 
| Developers     |Manages problems of service| 
| User        |Uses the application for locating gas stations and checking prices, but can also add/update fuel prices|
 | Google Maps        |External service used to offer service of maps|

# Stories and personas
Most of people typically travel a lot by car, so they usual need to refuel their vehicle. An administrator of gas stations would like to show its fuel prices online. The idea is to create a service (website and app) that allows users to show a map with all gas stations and their information. Of course, these stations have to agree with the service in order to be showed. These prices can be added/updated by the administrator or user for each gas stations by means a personal section in the website.

Each administrator can register in this service by means a specific section separated by user registration page because it needs more controls to verify the ownership of gas stations. The administrator can add or remove gas stations from the service, but also manage prices.

Users just need to create an account on the website/app to use the service. Afterwise, they get a personal area where they can add/update fuel prices and show the map with gas stations information. The map is directly implemented in the website/app.

Notice that for semplicity only the last update on price for each type of fuel is shown for each gas station.
