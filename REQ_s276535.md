# Abstract

EZGas is an application whose aim is to collect the prices of fuels in different gas station and to locate the gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice. 
The users of this application should be able to:
- Add the price of the fuel in a gas station
- Search the price of the fuel in a gas station
- Search a gas station on the map according to some parameter, such as the distance, the prices or the types of the fuel, etc.


# Stakeholders

# Stories and personas
Andrea is a track driver and he carries goods from the factories to the clients. As he travels a lot from a city to another and from a region to another, he knows well where Gas stations are located and he is also able to remember the prices of the fuel offered by the different gas stations. As when he started with this job he wasted a lot of time in looking for gas stations with convenient prices, he would like to offer the knowledge that he has acquired in order to help other car drivers. Thanks to the EZGas application he could make available all the information about gas stations and prices to all the interested users.



Antonio is a man who has moved from Puglia to Piemonte for job. Everytime he has to go on holydays in Puglia, he travels with his car. Moreover the car runs on methane gas, so it is almost impossible to find a gas station suitable for his car. As the way is really long, he would like to know where the Gas stations are and where the prices are convenient, in order to spare money.
EZGas would be perfect for him, because, according to where he is, he could find the nearest gas station with the best prices.
