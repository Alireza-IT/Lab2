# Abstract

As we know different types of gases offer different prices at different fuel station. This application basically simplifies the procedure as we can check the prices of the gas at the own comfort of the user.

# Stories and personas
The CEO develops a web application through which the users can check the prices of the fuels in different work station.
Mr.Harry got a transport company. The Sundays of every weekend he was to put fuel to his 3 trucks so that they can start working from Monday again. 

He opens the web application from his smartphones.He checks the prices of fuels of different gas station. He decides to use Q8 as finds out that the price of Q8 is less then others for example repsol. He informs his workers and share the location of the gas station in whatsapp and ask him to go there and fill the fuel to the trunk. 

Sometimes it even happens that while the worker are on their work the gas finishes the workers can quickly login in the platform of EZgas and compare the prices of the gases in different fuels and decide the one they prefer. The google Map will easily help to locate the nearest fuel station.
