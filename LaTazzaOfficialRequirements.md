# Abstract

Some colleagues share a coffee machine in a common space for breaks. Capsules are left aside the machine. Whoever uses a capsule writes this down in a notebook left aside the coffee machine. One of the colleagues (called *administrator*) copies consumptions in an excel sheet and collects money from colleagues to (re)order capsules.

One of the colleagues, the *hacker*, volunteers to develop a simple application to support the administrator. To keep things simple the application is standalone, and is meant to be used only by the administrator. Possibly the administrator role is taken by different colleagues over time. Instead of the notebook, the hacker sets up a WhatsApp group. Whenever a colleague uses a capsule, he sends a message to the group.

# Stories and personas
The CEO develops a web application through which the users can check the prices of the fuels in different work station.
Mr.Harry got a transport company. The Sundays of every weekend he was to put fuel to his 3 trucks so that they can start working from Monday again. 

He opens the web application from his smartphones.He checks the prices of fuels of different gas station. He decides to use Q8 as finds out that the price of Q8 is less then others for example repsol. He informs his workers and share the location of the gas station in whatsapp and ask him to go there and fill the fuel to the trunk. 

Sometimes it even happens that while the worker are on their work the gas finishes the workers can quickly login in the platform of EZgas and compare the prices of the gases in different fuels and decide the one they prefer. The google Map will easily help to locate the nearest fuel station.

# System Design
Not really meaningful in this case. Only one personal computer is needed.

```plantuml
class "Personal Computer"
```

# Deployment Diagram
As a stand-alone application only one node is needed.

```plantuml
artifact "La Tazza Application" as a
node "Personal Computer" as n
a -- n
```
