# Abstract

Gas stations daily change their price offering. To face the issue of looking for the best price available in their area, drivers have organized themselves in a Facebook group to share pictures of the price offered by the gas station they've visited. The people who have founded the group, the group administrators, accept user submissions and group the picture in photo albums separated per zone. However, the group size has grown significantly, and they cannot keep up with the submission rate anymore.

To solve this issue, they decided to launch a crowdsourcing initiative to develop an app that collects the prices of fuel in the gas stations and that locate them in an area, showing the prices. A group of developers has accepted to develop the application. They will substitute the Facebook group with a website. If a user is not registered can only choose to see the prices offered in an area by gas station. If he/she is registered and has logged in it can upload the prices offered by the gas station visited.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| User     |It directly uses the application, can look for the prices in an area and submit them. They are interested in a correct report of the pricing| 
| Administrator        |Is interested in the stability and usability of the application they've commissioned. They're also a kind of user|
| Map System        |It can impact the system whenever its API changes|
| Developer       | Is not a direct user of the application. It is interested in the development, maintenance and testability of the product.|

# Stories and personas
John is an administrator of the system. He likes to do long trips in his camper, spare money and help other travelers like him. This is why he decided to start the Facebook group to share gas stations' prices and then to crowdsource EZGas.
He is interested in an app with an intuitive and nice user interface, that can bring in as many users as possible. He is not interested in a way for managing reports of wrong pricing, since it is enough for a second user to report a new price.

Mary is a manager of a company and has to travel a lot in her car for work, so she would like to reduce her expenses in fuel.
Due to her work she is always in hurry, therefore Mary needs an user interface that let her to quickly see the cheapest gas station around her.

Joe is a developer of EZGas station. He likes to think about him as a very productive and organized guy.
Therefore he is interested in producing a good documentation for who will come after him in the development and in producing a highly modularized code.
