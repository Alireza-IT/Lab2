## Abstract

Modern life forces us to be constantly in motion, and living in a city implies to do so relatively fast. Basically, we can choose between two choices: using the public transportation system or driving a vehicle. If we go for the second, our car, motorcycle or whatever it is will need sooner or later to be refueled, but can we in some way optimize this process?

The goal of this application is to give to common drivers the possibility to choose the right gas station on the base of two main factors: the gas price and distance from our position. Each driver can share these informations with others to create a community, where the user is the core of the process.

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description |

| Driver                | Uses the application to find the right gas station for its needs. Also is able to share informations about gas stations and reviewing those of other users. |
| Gas Station Personnel | Cannot share informations about his/her gas station, but can review what users share about it. Giving him/her the possibility to share informations like prices could lead to false advertisement. |

## Stories and personas

Luke is a salesman, he works for a coffee distributor, and every day delivers products all across the city, so he drives a lot. His company refunds only a limited amount of the gas that he actually uses for his job. Until now he refuels his truck at the gas station near his office, but their prices aren't always the lowest. Since he moves a lot, the app could help him to find the best prices near his clients, and to share this information with other co-workers.

Anna works in an office that is in the city center, while she lives in the suburbs. In the trip to work, she encounters a lot of gas stations, but she can't know which one has the lower price during that day. With the EZGas app, she could find it and also gain discount prices with the coupons she receives.

Charlotte is the CEO of a new local fuel retailer, and so she's in search of market opportunities. Since her company has just started, nobody knows them. Having the possibility to show themself on the EZGas App may lead to a lot of new clients.
