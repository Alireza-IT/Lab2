# Abstract

A group of friends took a trip with the car around Italy to visit the most important cities. They soon discovered that refuel the car was really expensive. They also noticed that as soon as they stopped in a gas station the next one would have been cheaper. This fact led them to think about a way to avoid that and they soon reached a solution. Provide a service that helps people to know which is the cheapest gas station around them. 

This led to the launching of a crowdsourcing service that would help to collect all the prices of the different gas stations. The system should be organized so that people can share the prices of the stations where they refueled in order to collect as many information as possible. Then they should be able to select the area they are interested in and seeing all the gas stations present along with the prices they offer. In this way, they would be able to save money choosing the station with the best prices. 


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrators        |Do not use the application directly. They are interested in the stability of the product they commission.| 
| Users     |Use the application to send new information or to select a gas station.| 
| Developers        |They develop the application and check the stability.| 
| Maps       |This service is needed to provide a view of the maps|

# Stories and personas
Marco is one of the friends that commissioned the application. He is a cheerful guy that loves to stay with his friends. He likes his group of friends because they all enjoy visit new cities and they all reflect his need to be very well organized. Because of this, when they organize a new trip they meticulously list all what they are going to do and, most important, how much they would spend. Unfortunately, the fuel cost occupies always a large percentage of expenses and this may prevent them to do extra things. This is why they thought about a way to find the cheapest gas station around them.

Their idea was to provide a service to everyone who may need it. As it requires a lot of data, they decided to opt for a crowdsourcing service, to which whoever wants can contribute by uploading the prices of a gas station where she/he refueled. 

As Marco is the "tech one" in the group, he was asked to list some behaviors that a tool like that should not have. After a discussion on this list the realized that the most important feature of this tool would have been the stability. In fact, they want to provide a service that may help people, that is able to handle a lot of data and, most important, the user may rely on it so it must not have failures. 

Mirco is a driver that needs to know where to find a convenient gas station around him because it has to refuel his car. He decided to use EZGas in order to try it. So, he selects the area where he is and then he finds two possible stations. The first is the one with the lowest prices, so he decides to go there. When he arrives he finds out that the prices are even lower so he decides to report it on the application, in this way also the others can know it. To do that it had to sign up first in the application.
