# Abstract

If you have to face a long trip with your car and you don't know very well the path and the places that you will pass by, could be very useful to know where is the closest gas station and maybe, if there are more than one, which one is better in terms of distance and prices.

As it is constantly updated by the users, you may find out that the gas station that you are used to visit has increased the prices and could be more convenient to change habits.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     | Manages locations and prices of different gas stations in a specific area, in order to verify that are valid values. He also populates the area at the begininning with some gas stations and their prices. | 
| User              | Use the application directly, only to receive information about gas station and their prices. |
| Registered user   | Use the application diretly. Can add a gas station, add prices, modify them and can also leave a review of the service. |
| Google Maps       | Provides the map system in order to localize the user and the gas stations. |

# Stories and personas
Michael has to move a lot for work, from city to city, and as long as he has to respect some time schedule, he prefers to move with his own car. However, he founds frustrating that each time the prices of different gas stations are so different and therefore a long trip could be very expensive.

Michael would like to have a simple way to find which gas station has the best prices according to the road that he has to follow.

Jim is a truck driver who drives mostly in the night. When he has to take a new route, most of the times he doesn't know how many kilometers he can still travel before the next gas station.

In addition, Jim finds useful to know in which gas station he can have a sleep break and maybe something to eat, so a feedback from other users (specially other truck drivers) could be very useful.
