# Abstract

A group of students obsessed with their cars moved to another city to study engineering. They all love their cars and use them every weekend. But like all students they don't have much money, so they try to save it by choosing the cheapest gas stations. 
One of them, who studies management, tries to keep track of the prices of the different gas stations, but his system has a lot of issues, the info are often incomplete and not updated.

So the computer engineering student had the brilliant idea to create not only a database where keep track of the prices, but also a website, so it may be useful not only for the group of friends, but for everyone. This application is used by gas station managers to promote their stations, and by drivers who want to find the nearest or the cheapest gas station.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Record new gas station in the database

| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station G doesn't exist in the database |  
|  Post condition     | Gas station exists in the database |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator adds a new gas station to the database, writes down the fuel prices and locates the station on the map.|
|  Variants     | the form is not complete: warning |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 User interface for the insertion of the gas station

| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Database D exists without interface |  
|  Post condition     | Database D exists without interface |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator creates a user-friendly interface, a form to insert new stations and prices|
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Record of the price of the fuel

| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station G exists |  
|  Post condition     | for each gas station insert and update the prices |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator selects a gas station and inserts the prices|
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Search by distance

| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | some gas stations exist, GPS localization active|  
|  Post condition     | user finds the best gas station  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | user should be able to set the max distance in which searching the gas station |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 5, FR5 Search by price

| Actors Involved        | Administrator  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | gas station exists |  
|  Post condition     | user finds the best gas station  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | user should be able to set the max price and see the gas stations with these prices|
|  Variants     | |
