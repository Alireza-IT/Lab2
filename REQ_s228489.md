# Abstract

Today life has become more and more dinamic and owning a car is useful or in many cases even necessary. But cars need fuel and their owners need to refuel; but where and at which cost? EZGas can help them.

The purpose of this application is to locate and display every gas station in the area together with the prices the gas station's owners apply. The driver can decide whether to go to a specific station and pay less or to go to the nearest station.
