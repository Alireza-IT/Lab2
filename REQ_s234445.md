# Abstract

EZGas is an application whose aim is to offer a view of the possible gas stations and their prices. The service is crowdsourcing based and allows users to collect prices of fuel in different gas stations and to locate them in an area, along with the prices and the type of fuel they practice. The users should be able to add the location of a gas station and their prices, and search them on the map asking for the cheapest, the closest, the suggested one.

# Stakeholders

# Stories and personas

Gioele Rubinis is a truck driver and works for his family business "Rubini Pregiati", which is a factory specialized in the production of red candies. Gabriele has a wide knowledge of the roads and of gas station since he has worked as driver for 20 years and has driven several types of truck. He would like to make his skills available to the other drivers, for this reason he is a user of EZGas. Every time he stops to fuel during a business trip he check if the gas station is already available on the app. If it is, and it is necessary, he updates the prices, otherwise, thanks to the geolocalization he add a new gas station specifing the types of fuel offerd by the station and the relative prices. 

Daniele Toninello travels a lot beacause of his job, unfortunately, he is not so much skilled with travel . Moreover, last moth, he bought a new eletric car and isn't practical to locate the charging stations, so he would like an advice about them. For this reason wherever he is, he uses EZGas to find the closest station to charge his car and go on with his trip.
