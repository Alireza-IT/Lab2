# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service which shares prices of GasStations. Users can just use the service to check prices, but they can also interact adding untracked Stations or updated existing prices if they are obsolete.

The administrator is in charge of manage the service (User, accounts and Stations), accessing to the Gas stations data. He can check the utilization rate of the service, and can also make reports about the update rate of a singe Gas Station.

The service uses an external Map Service provider.

# Stories and personas
A user wants to find the cheapest gas station near his location. He also would like to inform other users when he find wrong or obsolete price, or just a gas station which is not recorded. The user can also check and signal the status of a Gas Station (if doesn't exist in reality, or closed).

A guest user just wants to find a near and cheap gas station. He his happy to see many gas station and up to date prices on EzGas service.
