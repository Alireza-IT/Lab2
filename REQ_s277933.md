# Stories and personas
John works in the office and has an inclination for order and discipline. So he volunteers to keep track of what happens on the coffee machine. When a capsule of a certain type is close to sold out John reorders. Capsules can be purchased only in multiples of a minimum quantity (ex 40). On the money side, John computes how much each colleague should pay for what she has consumed. In practice every colleague has a virtual account, initially charged with a reasonable amount of cash given to John (ex 10 euros). John maintains this account and asks to recharge it when close to zero. Physically the money for capsules is in cash, and John manages it as if it where his personal money.

All colleagues trust each other, so negative accounts are allowed. John uses his personal money if needed to reorder capsules. 

John is happy to do this work, but would like to hand over to someone else after a certain amount of time. In any case when he is on vacation another colleague takes over temporarily.

John would like to have a simple way to report (ex every one or two weeks) to each colleague all expenses and consumption for LaTazza. Without this report nobody has a clear idea of how much was the consumption.

Mary works in the office and likes to share time with her colleagues in front of the coffee machine. On the side of the coffee machine is a tray with capsules. When she wants a coffee (or else) she takes a capsule from the tray and tells to John. To do so she uses a whatsapp group (LaTazza friends).

Mr. Guest is a visitor in the office. As such he does not have the privilege of having an account. In case he can directly pay the capsule, cash, to John.
