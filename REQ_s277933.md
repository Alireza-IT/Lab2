# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     |Uses the application to register new gas stations| 
| User        |Uses the application to locate gas stations in their area and see the correspective prices|

# Stories and personas
Vincenzo is always carefull to the variable price of gas, he always used to write on his agenda today's price of all types of petrol at the stations closest to his home. He would like to have an app where the administators can record data and keep them updated.

Daniela is often on the move with her car for work and would like to know from time to time which are the most convenient gas stations to refuel in the area.

Users can select a radius in kilometres and on the map of the application will be showed all the fuel station in the circle, and the one having the best prices.

David is a registered user and can suggest price changes in a given station. (i.e. 2 per days: who needs to refuel more than twice a day?)

Mr. Guest is a non-registered user and can only visualize the prices.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Record new gas station

| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station S does not exists, totalStations totS exists|  
|  Post condition     | totS.quantity_post > totS.quantity_pre |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator selects for each fuel type T, selects gas station S, assign the given fuel price for type T in that gas station S|
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2  Update/Add price of fuel

| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Fuel type T of gas station S is not up to date or not exists|  
|  Post condition     | price_pre of S.type=T != price_post of S.type=T |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator selects fuel type T, select gas station S, update/assign the new price |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3  Suggest price update

| Actors Involved        | Registered User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Fuel type T of gas station S is not up to date or not exists|  
|  Post condition     |  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Registered user just report the update, waiting for an Admin to commit it |
|  Variants     | MAX two update report per day, if too many fake report: ban |
