# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations, and to locate those gas stations within an area, along with the prices they practice. The system is supported by a web application accessible both via PC or smartphone.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Customers | Use the application directly. They are interested in finding nearby gas stations offering the best prices. They are also interested in maintaining information about those gas stations up-to-date.| 
| Suppliers | Might use the application directly. They are interested in the correct representation of their offering as well as their precise location.|
| Government | Do not use the application directly. They are interested in assuring that laws regarding the user's privacy are being strictly followed. |
| Developers | Use the application directly. They are interested in the application correctness as well as responding to future maintenance. |

# Stories and personas
John Doe has decided to travel across the country by car on his vacation.  At one point, he sees that his vehicle is almost out of fuel, so he stops at the first gas station he can reach from the driveway and fill up the tank. When he's driving out, he receives a notification from EZGas asking him to confirm that he was recently at Gas Station X, as well as their prices. He spends a few seconds filling that information before continuing his trip.

Mary Jane is traveling around the same area as John Doe after a few weeks he passed by there. She does not know this area, so she uses EZGas to find a nearby station to fill up her tank. She finds that Gas Station X is close to her location, also captivated by their prices, she decides to stop there. When she arrives at the station she sees that their current prices don't match those informed by the app, so she notifies these changes and drives to the next station offering better prices.

Gas Station Y had recently opened in the same are of Gas Station X, being aware of the EZGas app, they log in with a company account and create a profile for their station to attract new customers.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

|  FR1     | Record data of n gas stations. |
|  FR2     | Report all recorded stations within an area. |
|  FR3     | Recognize that a customer has been recently to a gas station. |
|  FR4     | Notify customers to check data from a gas station. |
|  FR5     | Record changes reported by users. |
|  FR6     | Manage profiles from personal and company accounts.|

## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
| NFR1 | Functionality   | All recorded stations of a given area must be reported  | FR2 |
| NFR2 | Reliability     | Application should maintain the information about gas stations always up-to-date.  | All FR |
| NFR3 | Reliability     | User's privacy must not be violated as well as their personal data must be carefully protected.  | All FR |
| NFR4 | Efficiency      | Search of stations should be as fast as possible. | FR2 |

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Record data of n gas stations

| Actors Involved        | Supplier, Customer|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station G exists physically |  
|  Postcondition     | G.CompanyAccount.area_post = coordinates |
| | G.CompanyAccount.price_post = price |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Gas station is registered in the system database, within its physical location and prices |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Report all recorded stations within an area

| Actors Involved        | Developer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station G exists |  
|  Postcondition   | GUI.area_post > G.CompanyAccount.area_pre |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The application presents to the user every gas stations located within the boundaries that the user has established in the search|
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Recognize that a customer has been recently to a gas station

| Actors Involved        | Developer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Driver D exists, Gas station G exists|  
|  Post condition     | D.PersonalAccount.area_pre = G.CompanyAccount.area_pre |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Using GPS location from the user, the application recognizes that this user has been recently to one registered gas station|
|  Variants     |  User has disabled live sharing location in its device|

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Notify customers to check data from a gas station

| Actors Involved        | Developer, Government |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Driver D exists, privacy laws|  
|  Post condition   | |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Any data from users must be treated according to the privacy laws imposed by the local government entity|
|  Variants     |  User has disabled notifications in its device|

### Use case 5, FR5  Record changes reported by users
