# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations, and to locate those gas stations within an area, along with the prices they practice. The system is supported by a web application accessible both via PC or smartphone.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Customer | Use the application directly. They are interested in finding nearby gas stations offering the best prices. They are also interested in maintaining information about those gas stations up-to-date.| 
| Supplier | Might use the application directly. They are interested in the correct representation of their offering and precise location, as well as using the service for checking their competition.|
| Government | Do not use the application directly. They are interested in assuring that laws regarding the user's privacy are being strictly followed. |
| Maps Platform | Do not use the application directly. Third-party application used for displaying map, place details, geocoding, and geolocation. |

# Stories and personas
John Doe has decided to travel across the country by car on his vacation.  At one point, he sees that his vehicle is almost out of fuel, so he stops at the first gas station he can reach from the driveway and fill up the tank. When he's driving out, he receives a notification from EZGas asking him to confirm that he was recently at Gas Station X, as well as their prices. He spends a few seconds filling that information before continuing his trip.

Jane Doe is traveling around the same area as John Doe after a few weeks he passed by there. She is not familiar with this area, so she uses EZGas to find a nearby gas station to fill up her tank. She finds that Gas Station X is close to her location, captivated by their prices, she decides to stop there. When she arrives at the station she sees that their current prices don't match those informed by the app, so she notifies these changes and drives to the next station offering better prices.

Gas Station Y had recently opened in the same area of Gas Station X, aware of the EZGas app, they immediately fill in the details about their services. The administrator of Gas Station X then uses EZGas to check if their competitors are offering better prices. The administrator then uses his or her account to change the details of Gas Station X after lowering their prices.

When opening EZGas, the user has the option of entering its current location manually or via geolocation services. A map containing all gas stations within a 1 km radius would then be displayed on the user's screen afterward. The user could then select one of the pins representing those gas stations to reveal the details about them. Only signed up users can claim modifications in those details. When the service recognizes that another signed up user has visited that gas station, it would ask that user to check and confirm that claim. After a certain number of replies, the system would then record any modification if necessary.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|   FR1 | Display all gas stations within an area. |
|   FR2 | Allow only signed up users to modify details about gas stations. |
|   FR3 | Notify users that had been to a gas station with a registered claim. |
|   FR4 | Record modifications after n users replied to the survey. |
|   FR5 | Manage profiles. |

## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
| NFR1 | Functionality   | All recorded stations within a 1 km radius from the user's location must be displayed in the map | FR1 |
| NFR2 | Reliability     | Application should maintain the information about gas stations always up-to-date.  | All FR |
| NFR3 | Reliability     | System should not make distinctions beetwen unsigned and signed users regarding their privacy and data, information about their geolocation must not be shared without their concent. | All FR |
| NFR4 | Reliability     | System must ask at least 10 signed users to confirm a claim made by another user before recording the modifications reported. | FR3 - FR4 |
| NFR5 | Efficiency      | Response from third-party API that displays those gas stations to the user should be as fast as possible. | FR1 |
| NFR6 | Efficiency      | The survey must be simple and easy to reply, not taking more than a few seconds. | FR3 |
| NFR7 | Usability      | The application has to be intuitive for all users, with a friendly interface. | All FR |
| NFR8 | Portability     | The application runs on both desktop and mobile versions. | All FR |
| NFR9 | Localization    | Decimal numbers use . (dot) as decimal separator. |
| NFR10 | Localization    | The application should support different currencies. |

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Display all gas stations within an area.

| Actors Involved        | Developer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition    | Gas station G exists in Maps Platform |  
|  Postcondition   | GUI.area_post = API.area_pre |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The application displays to the user every gas station within a 1 km radius from users location|
|  Variants     | Gas station does not exist in the database and must be created by a signed up user |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Allow only signed up users to modify details about gas stations.

| Actors Involved        | Developer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | User U is logged in, Gas station G exists|  
|  Post condition   | G.info_pre = U.info_post |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User register a claim to a certain gas station requiring details to be modified |
|  Variants     | |
