# Stories and personas
Matteo is a computer science engineer and works in a company located in the suburbs of Turin, so to go to work every day, it takes at least 20 minutes with his car in the morning and 35 minutes in the evening to return home at the end of the business day.
Usually every Three days he refuels his car in the way home from the company when he finds a gas station along the way.
Very often the company send Matteo to other branches all over Italy in order to help other teams with important projects and supervise the work done. He usually do business trips with the company car and travels on an average of 600 km every business trip for two days so he refuels the car at least twice. The company gives Matteo an expensive account so he doesn't care too much of the fuel's cost during these trips but wants to refuel the car fast and efficiently in order to not to spend much time.

Matteo would like to have a simple way to know which are the nearest gas stations and their cost during his usually way to home.

Matteo wants to be able to know quickly where is the near gas station from his location during his business trips.

Matteo would be happy to help others in his situation adding informations of new gas stations discovered during a business trip to improve de functionality of the app.
