# Stories and personas
Bruce is a rich businessman that needs to get gas for all his cars. He wants to keep his rich status and we know that gas is very expensive so everyday he has to travel across the city to find the lowest price. 
This is time consuming so he decided to build an app that can keep trace of gas stations in a crowdsourcing way.

At first the app will get the position of all gas station from an external database, then the users will update positions and prices.

Bruce wants to be sure that the prices inserted by the user are correct so there will be a upvote system that will favor proper values.

Bruce would like to get some money from this app so he inserted an ads service with an optional payment that will disable the ads.
