# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and to locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.
EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC).

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Developer   | In charge of developing and maintaining the application.| 
| User        | Uses the system and has interest in finding a gas station. |
| Map service | Service used by the system for maps and location informations. |

# Stories and personas
John has a large family and uses his car frequently both to bring his children to school and to go to work. He spends a lot of his budgets on fuel and would like to save some money occasionally. He does not mind to drive a little more to find a convenient gas station.

Paul and his group of friends are planning a road trip through Spain for the summer, they would like to save as much as possible on fuel. They would like to know the cheapest gas stations they can use along their trip.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Record a new gas station
| Actors Involved        | User, Map service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | User visits a gas station GS which is not present in the system|  
|  Post condition     | The gas station GS is now inserted and visible in the system|
|  Nominal Scenario     | User selects the position on the map and decide to add the gas station GS inserting the informations in a specific form |
|  Variants     | The inserted information is not complete, then the system will rely on other users to update them and complete the gas station page |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Update information of a gas station
| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition       | User visit a gas station GS already present in the system and wants to update its information |  
|  Post condition     | The information of gas station GS are now updated |
|  Nominal Scenario   | User selects gas station GS from the map or the list, then selects the information he wants to update and provides the new ones|
|  Variants           | User inserts a value equal to the previous one, the update is not performed. |
|| User inserts wrong or incomplete information, the system rely on other user to correct it|

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Delete a gas station
| Actors Involved        | Developer , User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | A user finds a gas station GS which is now closed and wants to delete it from the system |  
|  Post condition     | GS is no more present in the system |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User wants to delete GS, to do so he compiles a form to gives feedback about it, the administrator then delete GS from the system|
|  Variants     | Information can be incorrect, then the system will rely on other users to re-insert the gas station.|
||The information can be incomplete or non exhaustive, then the developer can contact the user using the email used in the form. |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR5 Research gas stations organized by fuel type, prices and distance

| Actors Involved        | User, Map service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     |  User U wants to search a gas station to re-fuel his vehicle|  
|  Post condition     | User U has found a gas station which corresponds to his needs |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User U inserts some filters as fuel type, maximum price, location or distance, then the system will provide a list or a map of the different gas stations |
|  Variants     |  |
