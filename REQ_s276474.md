# Abstract

Drivers need to know informations about gas stations. In particular, they want to know prices and precise position of gas stations in their neighboring area or in the middle of their road. They share these informations through EZGas, an application used to:

1 - collect prices of fuels in different gas stations

2 - locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Gas station owner   | Has to insert data about his own gas station |
| Driver              | Can search a specific gas station and confirm fuel price or signal an error |
| Map Service		  | External service used to map themselves and gas stations |

# Stories and personas

Tom is a bank worker who has been transferred in a office pretty far from his house. The bank has not provided Tom with a company car, so he must use his own vehicle. He would like to know what are the gas station in the middle of the road between his house and the bank and what are the ones with the lowest price. He also would like to communicate these informations to his colleagues and friends, in an efficient way. He discovers a new app, EZGas, where he can find gas stations located around his position and check their price.

Mark is the owner of a gas station located in a quite unknown road where there is little traffic every day. Affairs are not going well for Mark because few customers stop to his gas station, despite the fact that it has the lowest price of the entire province. He would like to find a way to make his station to be known to as many drivers as possible in a simple and zero-cost way. In order to do this, he use EZGas app. He can register his own gas station, keeping attenction to not insert wrong informations.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR2 Search GS from a list of the cheapest ones

| Actors Involved 		| Driver |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Log-in successful |
|  Post condition 	| Driver chooses a GS |
|  Nominal Scenario | The driver authenticates himself and can choose from a list of the cheapest GS |
|  Variants			| Error message if log in fails |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR3 Search GS from a list of the closest ones

| Actors Involved 		| Driver |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Log-in successful |
|  Post condition 	| Driver chooses a GS |
|  Nominal Scenario | The driver authenticates himself and can choose from a list of the closest GS |
