# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice

EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC)



# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| User              | Can input a position through GPS and a radius to get gas prices |
| LoggedInUser      | Can also signal change in gas prices |

# Stories and personas

## Personas
- Persona 1: middle age, middle-high income, professional
- Persona 2: young, low income, student

## Stories

- Emily travels every day for dozens of kilometers going and returning from work, so
she spends a considerable amount on gas. She wants to get home early to spend
more time with her family, so she use EZGas to quickly find a filling station with low
fuel prices.
- John lives in the town next to his university and each day he has to travel with his car
to follow the lessons. Since he has little income he would like to save on gas which is
a considerable expense, so John use EZGas to find the best fuel price from gas
stations along the way to university.
