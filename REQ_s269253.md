# Stories and personas
Nathan has a gas station outside a city, near an orbital road and want to be more known by the citizen of the near city. His prices are lower than the competitors and the location is quite strategic, but right now the citizens prefer to go to internal gas station, even if more expensive. Nathan would like to have a way to better advertise his prices.

Joel has a gas station in a highway: prices are quite high due to location, but his services are the best: there are a picnic area, a restaurant, restrooms with showers, a bar, a minimarket and a car wash service. He would like to better advertise his offer, in order to have more customers.

Jesse is a housewife: she rarely uses her car and when she does, she have problem to find proper gas station, since she has a gpl car. She would like to better understand where are gpl stations, so that she can move more with her car.Since there are few gpl stations, she also would like to keep under control those she knows and receive information if they change price.

Ash is a world traveler: with his camper he visited almost all Europe, but each time he arrives in a new city, he have some problems to find properly gas stations. He would like to check in advance where to go to refill his vehicle, in order to better organize his journeys.
