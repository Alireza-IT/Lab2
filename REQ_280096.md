# Abstract

Motorist often need to reach a gas station for refuel their vehicle. The fuel retail price is not global fixed and everyone, everytime, tries to choose the cheapest one in their zone. This can means, sometimes, to move from one supplier to another, in order to find the most convenient.

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allow *active users* to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations, and let *passive users* to locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice. In this way is really easier to locate the best gas station for your needs.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Users |Uses the application to collect prices of fuels (active) or uses the application to navigate within the different prices of different gas stations in an area and rates the prices (passive)|
| Administrator | Creates gas stations list, thinks about new hypotetical functionalities | 
| Developer | Develop and mantain application |
| Database service | Host all the needed informations |
| Map Service | OpenStreetMap API service for mapping and geolocalization |

# Stories and personas

Andrew is a motorist and owns a car that he uses everyday for cover his 30' trip to work. Once a week or so, he need to reach a gas station for refuel his vehicle. Often, he choose the first one that he meets when he leaves his workplace, at the end of the day. Frequently he realizes that just short distance away, he could have refueled at a lower price. On the other hand, sometimes, when he thinks that the price of the first gas station is too high, he tries to reach the next one which however presents an even higher price. He is facing a crossroads: going back to save money while wasting time or refueling at the most expensive station? Andrew would like to use a tool that allows him to consult the fuel price in advance, in order to choose the most convenient gas station, without wasting time. 

Patricia and Gareth are two other commuters that everyday goes by the main road near Andrew's workplace,sometimes early in the morning, sometimes late in the evening. They always use EZGas for checking the fuel price in advance. Every time they stop himself to refuel, they insert their update price report. They chose EZGas, due to his scoring systems so they can trust a price when is a well-scored user to report it.

In this way, Andrew has the way to choose in advance the gas station to refuel his vehicle and save time and money.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Use Cases
### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Manage gas stations
| Actors Involved 	| Administrator |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
|  Precondition		| (Creation) GS doesn't exist |
| 					| (Edit or delete) GS already exists |  
|  Post condition	|  |
|  Nominal Scenario	| Administrator creates,edit,delete gas station GS |
|  Variants			|  |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Produce the list of all Gas stations with prices ordered by name,distance,price
| Actors Involved	| User |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
| Precondition		| In the radious of 5km exists at least one GS |  
| Post condition	|  |
| Nominal Scenario	| User want to see the GS list |
| Variants			| GS prices not updated since 2 days, issue warning |
### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Add a new price for a specific fuel in a specific gas station
| Actors Involved	| User |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
| Precondition		| GS exists |  
| Post condition	|  |
| Nominal Scenario	| User knows the fuel price and updates the information |
| Variants			|  |
### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Rates the prices
| Actors Involved	| User |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
| Precondition		| GS exists |
| 					| It is present a fuel price update related to the selected GS in the last two days |  
| Post condition	|  |
| Nominal Scenario	| User has chosen the GS through the app and once reached, confirms or denies the price presented |
| Variants			|  |
### Use case 6, UC5 - FR5 Manage personal gas stations preferite list (add, remove)
| Actors Involved	| User |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
| Precondition		| (add) GS exists && User has < 3 favorites GS |
| Post condition	|  |
| Nominal Scenario	| User selects the favorites GS (like a bookmark) for a faster price consultation, price rating or price update |
| Variants			|  |
### Use case 7, UC6 - FR6 Manage threshold for price notifications
| Actors Involved	| User |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
| Precondition		|  |
| Post condition	|  |
| Nominal Scenario	| User can insert a threshold for receive a notification when the nearest GS fuel price falls below the threshold |
| Variants			|  |
### Use case 8, UC7 - FR7 User algorithm-based reliability score
| Actors Involved	| User, Developer |
| ------------- 	|:-------------:| 
| Precondition		|  |  
| Post condition	|  |
| Nominal Scenario	| When a User run the app for the first time, it is marked with a random id. Every price update is linked with an id and a reliability score is calculated from the user rates. When a User consults the prices, he can see an icon that show an high or low score. |
| Variants			|  |

# Relevant scenarios

## Scenario 1

| Scenario ID: SC1	| Corresponds to UC3 |
| ------------- 	|:-------------| 
| Description 		| User insert a new price report |
| Precondition 		| |
| Postcondition 	| Algorithm evaluates whether to show a different price than the current one |
| Step#        		| Step description   					|
|  1     			| User selects the GS 	|  
|  2     			| User selects the 'Update price' option |
|  3     			| User inserts the update price and confirm	|
| 4 				| Algorithm adds the price report in the DB and recalculate what price to show for that GS |

## Scenario 2

| Scenario ID: SC2        | Corresponds to UC4 |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | User rates the price showed by the app |
|Precondition | Already exists an updated (in the last two days) price report |
|Postcondition | The user reliability score of the user who entered the price is updated |
| Step#        | Step description  |
|  1     | User select the GS |  
|  2     | User selects the 'Rate price' options |
|  3     | User vote up/down and confirm |
|  4     | Algorithm adds the rate in the DB and recalculate what price to show for that GS |

# System Design
The application is composed by a client-side app (on mobile phone or web app) and by an online server that host a database.

```plantuml
class "Mobile phone" as mp
class "Online server" as os	
mp <--> os
```
