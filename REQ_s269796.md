# Abstract

The car drivers need to refuel. The entire territory is divided in areas where there are different gas stations at which drivers can refuel. The price of fuel is different at each gas station and the car drivers want to find the gas station in the own area with the lowest price. To solve this problem is implemented EZGas, a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:

+ collect prices of fuels in different gas stations

+ locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.
EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC).
The collection of prices in different gas station is at the beginning initializated with data found on the Internet mixed with data sent by the gas station owners and it is updated by the users in runtime.
The localization of the gas station and other addictional funtionalities are supported by other service like Google maps.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Users       |Use the application directly. They are interested in updating the prices of fuel and to find the lowest price in the area. Users can be car drivers or gas station owners.|
|Maps service| Provides the maps to locate the gas stations. A map service can be Google maps.|

# Stories and personas
John is a car driver and every morning, before going to work, he always checks the fuel level in his car. When it's necessary a refuel, he wants to do quickly because he can't arrive late at work but he wants also to save money. So when he get in the car he opens the EZgas application on his smartphone to find the gas stations on the way for work with the lowest price. He would like to know not only the gas station with the lowest price but also the distance from it in order to know if he can arrive to that gas station with the remaining fuel.

Bob is the owner of a gas station and every morning if there is a difference in the price of fuel he update the sign in the station with the new price, then he update the price in the EZgas service from the PC in his office.

Alice is a truck driver and during her long trip she stop sometimes in gas stations for a short break. During these stops she can read the actual price of the fuel in that gas station and update it on the web service through her smartphone. 

To verify the correctness of the updated price, because there is no way to verify the declatation of the user, an update is done only if at least 3 people agree about the the same price.  


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  *FR1*     |*Management of price*|
|  FR1.1	 | Record the price of fuel at each gas station |
|  FR1.2   | Record the reportings of users about the modification of price|
|  FR1.3   | Record the number of reportings about a specific gas station to validate the update of price|
|  FR1.4   | Validate the update of price|
|	*FR2*		 | *Management of position*|
|  FR2.1   | Take the position of a user and show all the gas stations around him. |
|  FR2.2   | Calculate the distance between the user and each gas station in his area|
|  *FR3*     | *Management of types of users* | 
|	FR3		 | Filter the gas station based on the characteristics chosen by the user: type of fuel, type of assistance, type of payment.|


## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     | Usability | Application should be used with no training | All FR |
|  NFR2     | Performance | All functions should complete in < 0.5 sec  | All FR except FR1.4|
|  NFR3     | Portability | The application is based on web so it is device independent. It is accessible both via smartphone or PC with the only condiction of a stable Internet connection. | All FR |
|NFR5| Reliability | The reliability of the service is based on the activity and declarations of the users. | Only for FR1|
|NFR6 | Maintainability | Once the service is launched, the users themselves maintain it functional updating the prices.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1.1  Record the price of fuel at each gas station

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The gas station GS exists and works, User u can know the price of the fuel, the GS sells the fuel F, the fuel F has no price yet|  
|  Post condition     | F.price = price |
| | F.price*pre* == 0, F.price*post* != 0|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The first user arrives in a gas station GS, see the price of a fuel F and set the price of that fuel|
|  Variants     | |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR1.2 Report change in price

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The gas station GS exists and works, User u can know the price of the fuel, the GS sells the fuel F, the fuel F has an incorrect prive |  
|  Post condition     | F.price < price |
| | F.price*pre* != F.price*post* |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The user arrives in a gas station GS, see the price of a fuel F and if it different from the actual one sends the new price to the service. After a threashold of notification the price is updated|
|  Variants     | The notification does not pass the threshold. |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR2.1 Check the gas station in the area

| Actors Involved        | Map Service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The Gas GS station exists, the Map service works |  
|  Post condition     | GS.position = coordinates |
|  | GS.position*pre* = NULL, GS.position*post* = coordinates |
|  Nominal Scenario     | A query is sent to the external Map service and the positions of the gas stations are returned|
|  Variants     ||

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR3.1 Filter the gas stations

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The gas GS station exists, there are no filters on the type of gas station|  
|  Post condition     | GS.Fuel.type = typeFuel && GS.type_of_payment = payment && GS.type_of_assistance = assistance |
| | GS.Fuel.type = all && GS.type_of_payment = all && GS.type_of_assistance = all|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The user wants to find only the gas stations with specific characteristics|
|  Variants     ||
