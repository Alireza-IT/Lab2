# Abstract

Car divers are need to have a place where they can find and compare every gas station in a specific area with their relative prices.
Gas stations managers want to advertise their gas stations to all drivers, especially the ones not familiar with the area.

EZGas is an application that allows both drivers and gas stations managers to see and compare gas prices anywhere in Italy.

# Stories and personas
Robert's job requires a lot of travel all around the country.
He often finds himself in places where he's never been. 
He has to make sure to never run out of gas and, where possible, to save money on fuel.
He signs up to EZGas and uses it to easily find the most convenient gas station everywhere he goes.
Not only he's not worried anymore about gas, but he also spends much less than before.

Marc is the manager of a gas station just ouside town.
He has many clients, but not as many as the onther  gas station which is on a much more trafficked road.
His prices are lower but he still has fewer clients.
He uses EZGas to add his gas station on the map and to manage his gas prices.
Soon after he sees an increase on the number of sales, meaning that many drivers found his gas station using EZGas.
He now earns much more than before.
