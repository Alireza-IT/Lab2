# Abstract

The idea is to develop a crowdsourcing application, called EZGas, whose goal is to provide to users a service. This service consists in:
* search for gas stations that provide a particular kind of fuel in a ceirtain area
* visualizing them on a map, with their prices

so that the user can decide, basing on prices and distances, the one to choose to get the gas.
There are basically two groups of people who will use the application. There are the **users**, that can be divided into *Registered* and *Unregistered*; the difference is that for the first ones, the search history and their informations (living and/or working area, kinds of fuels preferred ) will be recorded in order to provide a better service. Then ther are the **gas stations' owners** that will interact with the application by inserting their informations (location, kinds of fuels, prices) and updating them in real time.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|Users|They directly use the application, by searching for the gas stations that have the needed kind of fuel and finding them on a map| 
|Gas stations' owners|He or she interacts with the application in order to insert and update his data (fuel prices)|
|Developer|The one who develop the application, he or she has to make the application the easiest as possible so that many users will use it, and many gas organizations will be interested|
|DB Administrator|Manages the DB that records data of gas stations in order to provide the service the application is developed for|
