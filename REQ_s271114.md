# Abstract

The idea is to develop a crowdsourcing web application, called EZGas, whose goal is to provide to users a service. This service consists in:
* search for gas stations that provide a particular kind of fuel in a ceirtain area
* visualizing them on a map, with their prices so that the user can decide, basing on prices and distances, the one to choose to get the gas.

There are basically two groups of people who will use the application. There are the **users**, that can be divided into *Registered* and *Unregistered*; the difference is that for the first ones, the search history and their informations (living and/or working area, kinds of fuels preferred ) will be recorded in order to provide a better service. Then ther are the **gas stations' owners** that will interact with the application by inserting their informations (location, kinds of fuels, prices) and updating them in real time.
The visualized gas stations can belong to the selected city, but also to the other citys in the same province; this in thought mostly for offering a better service to the user that lives in medium-small citys where there may be a few number of gas stations.   


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|Users|They directly use the application, by searching for the gas stations that have the needed kind of fuel and finding them on a map| 
|Gas stations' owners|He or she interacts with the application in order to insert and update his data (fuel prices)|
|Developer|The one who develop the application, he or she has to make the application the easiest as possible so that many users will use it, and many gas organizations will be interested|
|DB Administrator|Manages the DB that records data of gas stations in order to provide the service the application is developed for|

# Stories and personas

John is a car owner that lives in a big city. He is a salesman and he uses his car each day to work, travelling all around the city and in the metropolitan area. Each day he goes in differnt zones of the city, and he often needs to get gas in order to keep working, and he often doesn't know where to go to get the gas, since he doesn't know well all the places he goes to. For this reason, the EZGaz application really makes his days, since now he no longer need to turn around for minutes before finding an open gas station, and in addition he can choose the one with a lower cost, or, the one placed in the road he's going to pass in a moment, in order not to waste time.

His friend, Mark, lives instead in a small country. There, is not always easy to find a gas station since there are only few of them, and not all have GPL, the fuel he needs. For this reason, he made an account to the EzGas application, and eavry time he needs to get GPL, he only need to login and click the button of his las search to find all the available gas stations that are open around his area.

Even Ken is finding useful this application. He just opened a new gas station in his city, but he is not in one of the main roads of the city, and at the beginning, even if he tried to attract some customer by offering his service at small prices, no one knew that he was there. But now that the EZGas application is so widespread among the citizens and not only them, everyone knows where he is and now he can be competitive in his job sector.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1, FR2 gas stations research and visualization
| Actors Involved  | Maps system, User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | the area of serearch is valid (the city exists, and, if prompted, the address exists) |  
|  Post condition     | a list of possible gas stations with positions and prices |
|  Nominal Scenario   | the user selects an area and optionally a kind of fuel, the applications retrieve a list of actually opened gas stations that have that kind of fuel with prices and that are in the province of the selected city, then the application filters the result to find the ones that are in an area of 5 km around the address selected (if selected) throug the Maps system' APIs, then thorugh other APIs it  visualize the selected gas stations with their prices|
|  Variants     |  the area can be selected by using GPS, by inserting a city (with or without an address), by selecting from the list of frequent searches (for *Registered* users only)|

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR3 visualization of best route

| Actors Involved  | Maps system, User|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|Pre condition| the user has selected on the map one gas station |
|Post condition| visualization of best route|
|Nominal Scenario| if an address has been inserted, the best route is retrieved thorough the Maps system's APIs and visualized with distance and percurrence time|
|Variants| if the user didn't inserted the address, a default one is used, retrieved from the Maps system (city center adress)|

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR5 edit fuels' prices
| Actors Involved  | Gas station's owner|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|Pre condition| the owner must have an account|
|Post condition| F.price = new_price |
|Nominal Scenario| the owner selects a fuel F, update its F.price from old_price to new_price |
|Variants|the owner may add a new fuel and then insert the price|
