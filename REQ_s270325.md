# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing application that allows users to collect price of fuels in different gas stations and to locate gas stations in an area, according with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Car drivers   |Generic users that use the application to collect and provide information about gas stations fuel prices.| 
| Gas companies        |Do not use the application directly, but analysing data they can trace the customers behaviour.|
|Developers|They have to deal with the correct testability and functionality of the service, and they have to initialize the system.| 
|Google Maps|It has to provide API to developers.|
|External websites|Have to provide an initial list of gas stations.|

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Initialize the map with the provided list(s) of gas stations

| Actors Involved        | Developers |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The provided lists exist |
||#stations=0|  
|  Post condition     | #stations= n|
|  Nominal Scenario     | Developers get the provided lists from one or more external websites and, according to the spacial coordinates, they add the gas stations to the map. |
|  Variants     | One or more lists are empty, issue warning |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Update the fuel price for a type of fuel of a gas station. 

| Actors Involved        |Registred Users  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The user is authenticated. |
||The gas station exists.| 
||The indicated price is different from the actual one or does not exist yet. | 
|  Post condition     | A new price is indicated. |
|  Nominal Scenario     |A registred user goes to a gas station and finds out a different prices from the one declared in the application for a certain type of fuel, so he wants to warn other users changing it. |
|  Variants     | Two users want to change the price at the same time.  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Display gas stations on the map 

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The map exists |  
|  Post condition     |#displayed_current>=0  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The user wants to know all the gas stations in a certain area|


### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Add a new gas station on the map

| Actors Involved        | Developers or Registered User|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Spacial coordinates are valid|
||The user is authenticated|
||The declared gas station does not exist yet.|  
|  Post condition     | #stations= #stations+1 |
|  Nominal Scenario     | An user finds out that there is a new gas station, and wants to warn the other users adding it.|
|  Variants     | Two users want to add the same gas station at the same time. |

### Use case 5, FR5 Delete a gas station

| Actors Involved        | Registered User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | The declared gas station is on the map but does not exist anymore|  
||The user is authenticated|
|  Post condition     | #stations= #stations-1 |
|  Nominal Scenario     | An user finds out that there is no more a gas station, and wants to warn the other users deleting it.|
|  Variants     | Two users want to delete the same gas station at the same time. |


### Use case 6, FR6 Filter the gas stations on the map accordingly to different price ranges and type of fuel

|  Precondition     | Range of price and type of fuel that the user wants exist. |  
|  Post condition     | #displayed_current <= #displayed_past> |
