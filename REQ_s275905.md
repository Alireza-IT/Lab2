# Abstract

This application is oriented to two types of user: Administrators and Customers.

Customers would like to collect prices of different gas stations in order to comparing and choising the best based on the ratio best-price/distance. 
 

To perform this comparison the user must use an setnav system which will show him/her the stations in the area.
The system should authenticate the customer ID and position in order to update possible shown results.

The application must also be able to check if the customer is a fidelty client in order to apply him/her discounts/gifts.
The fidelity of a client is mainly based on the number of feedbacks the user have done so far.
The more feedback the customer does, the most benefits he/she receives.

 Gas price can be updated periodically (daily). This task is in charge of an administrator. In doing so, the administrator should always check changes among the prices. On this purpose, he/she periodically receives a message with the information.
 If many feedbacks report complaints about prices, the administrator must be able to change accordingly.
 On this purpose, the administrator checks all the given feedbacks of users.

 The administrator is also able to help the user when is asked, both for helping and for advertising some promotions.


# Stakeholders

# Stories and personas
David is driving away for a family holiday. So, after having drived for a while he needs to gas up. He should turn on his location by using an existing setnav application (such as Google Maps, Waze, etc) in order to find a near petrol station. Being a fidelity client of Q8 and Esso, he can apply for some discount by using his client cards. 

So the system, when possible, should prioritize the companies to which David is a fidelity client. It should additionally both authenticate the user and checking the current validity of his/her card.

On the other hand, Roger is the administrator of the neighbourhood gas stations who should update the information about price and promotion availability.
Some additional gifts can be given to the fidelity clients during Christmas holidays.

Everytime clients like David use their own fidelty card, they must be sure about the validity of the card. If they use an invalid fidelty card (e.g. it is expired) an error message will be shown.
David can possibly renew the card by filling up a module online.

 For doing so, he should specify his userID and the Company name of the gas station (ex. Q8,Esso, etc.).
The system will then be in charge of contacting Roger who will aapprove the request.

In the meanwhile, Roger also sends David an additional promotion if he accepted to give a feedback. This feedback would be saved in the database of the local server which will be used to increase the fidelity level of David.
Once it has been done, David can keep driving away.
