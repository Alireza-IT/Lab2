# Abstract

People driving a car, whether it has a petrol, diesel or gas engine, need to get fuel from gas stations. The choice of a gas station is made considering mainly two factors: closeness of the pump and price of the fuel.

A team of developers decides to make this process easier by developing an application that retrieves data from the people contribute (crowdsourcing). Who downloads the app can use it either to locate the closest gas stations in the area along with their fuel prices or to contribute by updating the fuel price in an existing gas station.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description | 
| ---------------- |:-----------:|
| User | (profile 1) Car owner that uses the mobile application in order to discover close gas stations and suitable fuel price. (profile 2) Application user that updates a fuel price |
| Developer | Person who periodically tests the application and manages user accounts and eventual problems |

# Stories and personas

Eleonor is a young regional volleyball referee that cares about a smart management of her outgoings. She owns a car with diesel engine and because of her job she often needs to drive it around the region she lives in to reach all the sports hall where volley matches are held.
During her job trips, Eleonor always takes the smartphone and uses the navigator application to get oriented in highways and cities she has never visited before. Sometimes her car's fuel gauge gets in the red and she needs to find a gas station as soon as possible, but in a place she doesn't know at all. She has a favourite Oil Company where she can gain fidelity points for liters of fuel, otherwise she tries to pick the closest station in which the fuel price is lower.

Barbara is a mother with a son and a daughter. Every morning, before going to work, she brings them to the primary school following always the same street path that includes passing by two gas stations from two different Oil Companies. Barbara wants to be an example for her children and so, when she arrives at work, she always tells her collegues about the fuel prices she has read while driving the car, in order to let them choose the cheapest option if they need to fill up the gas.

Max is a 26 years old boy belonging to the developer team of an application, in particular the maintenance section. His role is to keep the application always updated and to check for eventual errors and bugs. He spends some of his work hours in reading feedbacks by users because they are the real engine of the the application. When he notices a problem in the app, discovered through his periodical tests or a user feedback, he warns the maintenance team and starts to check where does it come from, whether it is a database fault or a Google maps api connection problem or an other general bug.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR2 FR3

| Actors involved | User (profile 1) |
|-----------------|:----------------:|
| Precondition | User has the application installed on the smartphone, user has a valide account, user has the internet connection, user has locating service on | 
| Postcondition | User finds a gas station and its fuel price |
| Nominal scenario | User starts the application, his location is identified, gas stations in the area are shown along with their fuel prices |
| Variants | The first time the user starts the application, he should login with his account, if locating service don't work properly a warning should be issued |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR5
