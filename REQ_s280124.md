# Abstract
Car and truck drivers around the world are all interested in one thing: getting gas *for cheap*.   

EZGas is a mobile application that allows any driver to update the gasoline, diesel, LPG, and electricity prices of a gas station they visit, so that other drivers can easily find the most convenient gas station near them.  
The worldwide map EZGas is based on is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), that drivers can use to obtain the location of the nearest gas stations. 


# Stakeholders

| Name  | Description | 
| ----- |:-----------:|
| Users | Use EZGas either actively, by updating gas prices, or passively, by checking gas prices other users have set up | 
| Developers | Add features to EZGas, fix bugs of EZGas, release the app, deploy and update any server-side software |
| Database | Contains all the prices that users upload to EZGas | 
| Maps | Provide an API to access gas station locations |

# Stories and personas
Tom Honks is a truck driver always on the move. His company pays for gas, but he would like to start off on the right foot with the new boss. He is determined to find a way to reduce company costs to make a good impression and hopefully get a promotion to an office job, so he can stay more regularly at home with his family.  
He finally finds the solution to his problem: EZGas, a crowd-sourced application that allows all the truck drivers in his company to determine at which gas station to stop.  

---------

Jim and Pam are a young couple, and they love going to the mountains during the weekend. Since Jim already has a car, using a car sharing service would be more expensive, so that is out of the question. Being two students though, they don't have much money to spend on gas, and it is a long way to the mountains.  
EZGas is the perfect app for them: they can find gas near them at the best price to fill up the tank and go on their weekend trip!
