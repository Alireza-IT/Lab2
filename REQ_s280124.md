# Abstract
Car and truck drivers around the world are all interested in one thing: getting gas *for cheap*.   

EZGas is a mobile application that allows any driver to update the gasoline, diesel, LPG, and electricity prices of a gas station they visit, so that other drivers can easily find the most convenient gas station near them.  
The worldwide map EZGas is based on is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), that drivers can use to obtain the location of the nearest gas stations. 


# Stakeholders

| Name  | Description | 
| ----- |:-----------:|
| Users | Use EZGas either actively, by updating gas prices, or passively, by checking gas prices other users have set up | 
| Developers | Add features to EZGas, fix bugs of EZGas, release the app, deploy and update any server-side software |
| Database | Contains all the prices that users upload to EZGas | 
| Maps | Provide an API to access gas station locations |

# Stories and personas
Tom Honks is a truck driver always on the move. His company pays for gas, but he would like to start off on the right foot with the new boss. He is determined to find a way to reduce company costs to make a good impression and hopefully get a promotion to an office job, so he can stay more regularly at home with his family.  
He finally finds the solution to his problem: EZGas, a crowd-sourced application that allows all the truck drivers in his company to determine at which gas station to stop.  

---------

Jim and Pam are a young couple, and they love going to the mountains during the weekend. Since Jim already has a car, using a car sharing service would be more expensive, so that is out of the question. Being two students though, they don't have much money to spend on gas, and it is a long way to the mountains.  
EZGas is the perfect app for them: they can find gas near them at the best price to fill up the tank and go on their weekend trip!

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Show nearby world map
| Actors Involved        | User, Maps |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet |  
|  Post condition | M displayed on U's screen |
|  Nominal Scenario | User opens application and sees Maps |
|  Variants | Maps not available, issue error |
| | Internet connection not available, issue warning |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR1.1 Search for a place on the map
| Actors Involved        | User, Maps, Location |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet, Location L exists |  
|  Post condition | Location searched is displayed on U's screen |
|  Nominal Scenario | U searches for L and L is displayed on M |
|  Variants | Maps not available, issue error |
| | Internet connection not available, issue warning |
| | Location does not exist, issue warning |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR1.2 Show recently visited gas stations
| Actors Involved        | User, Database |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Database DB is available on the Internet |  
|  Post condition | Database entries are pulled and displayed |
|  Nominal Scenario | U taps searchbar on screen, a brief list of the most recently visited gas stations appears |
|  Variants | Internet connection not available, issue warning |
| | Database not available, issue error |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR2 Record updated gas station price to database
| Actors Involved        | User, Maps, Gas Station, Database |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet, Database DB is available on the Internet |  
|  Post condition | Database entry is updated |
|  Nominal Scenario | U taps GS on M and inputs data, uploaded to DB |
|  Variants | Maps not available, issue error |
| | Internet connection not available, issue warning |
| | Database not available, issue error |
| | Price validation error, issue error |

### Use case 5, UC5 - FR2.1 Perform trust-based check before updating price
| Actors Involved        | New Price as NP, Database as DB |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|  Precondition  | NP is received at DB |  
|  Post condition | NP is saved to DB |
|  Nominal Scenario | If NP is within a margin of error (e.g. 0.1â‚¬) from the last X user-submitted prices, then the price for that gas station and that type of fuel is updated to the average of the last X prices and is displayed in-app to the users; the last X prices are removed from the database. X is calculated based on how many NPs are received per day at each gas station, and is a gas station property. |
| | Else, save the price to DB. |

# Relevant scenarios

## Scenario 1

| Scenario ID: SC1 | Corresponds to UC4  |
| ---------------- |:--------------------| 
| Description | User updates gas prices of a pre-existing gas station |
| Precondition | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet, Database DB is available on the Internet |
| Postcondition | Database entry is updated |
| Step #        | |
| 1 | User opens EZGas app |  
| 2 | Maps are displayed on the screen |
| 3 | User taps on gas station |
| 4 | User updates a price for a type of fuel |
| 5 | The new price is recorded in the database |
