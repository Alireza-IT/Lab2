# Abstract
Car and truck drivers around the world are all interested in one thing: getting gas *for cheap*.   

EZGas is a mobile application that allows any driver to update the gasoline, diesel, LPG, and electricity prices of a gas station they visit, so that other drivers can easily find the most convenient gas station near them.  
The worldwide map EZGas is based on is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), that drivers can use to obtain the location of the nearest gas stations.
