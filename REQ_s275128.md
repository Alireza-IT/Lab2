# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| User | Uses the application to add new gas stations, add and update gas station prices, search for gas stations and relative prices on the map, together with many other users.|
| Google Maps APIs | Passive entity that doesn't use the application directly, but influences it because the application uses the APIs it privides.|
| Database of gas stations | Passive entity that doesn't use the application directly, but stores gas stations locations and relative prices so that users can retrieve and save data about gas station and prices.|

# Stories and personas
Catherine is a mother of two children. She works from home as an employee of her husband's business and does accounting, administration and fulfills several tasks, such as organizing appointments, paying taxes, recording invoices. Moreover, she is responsible for housekeeping and doing the shopping for her family. All these activities takes a lot of time of her weekdays, but don't require the use of the car. In order to lighten the stress, she really likes to go out in the weekends with her family. She likes to explore new places, doing long trips that require a lot of fuel for her car, and of course a lot of money spent. She wants to spend the least, but she doesn't know what are the best prices, because she visits those places for the first time. Catherine would like a fast and easy way to find the best gas stations in the area, without asking to local people or spending time manually searching for them on a search engine, such as Google.

Robert travels for work. He is a freelancer, and drives his car at least 4 hours per day.  He drives most of the times in highways, where gas prices are quite high and gas stations are very far one from each other. This makes him plan every movement so that he knows where to get gas, without having troubles and paying too much. He would like to have a rapid way of looking for the best gas stations in the route he's going to run across, and also update the database so that others with similar necessities can get the most out of this application.

Chris is a young man, 20 years old. He owns a nice motorcycle, but depends on his parents in order to get gas. He has a lot of friends which share his love for motorcycles. Together with his friends, he takes tours in the area where he lives, sometimes going quite far from his home town. His friends are of the same age, and thus depend on their parents in order to get gas. He would like to know where to find the best prices in his local area, as well as keep track and update prices together with their friends, so that they all can save money for other activities.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Insert new gas station

| Actors Involved | User, Database, Google Maps APIs |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Precondition | User has no account |
| Post condition | Gas station G is saved to database |
| Nominal Scenario | User select location on map, press new gas station button, choose name for gas station G, save G |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Select gas station and update gas prices

| Actors Involved | User, Database, Google Maps APIs |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Precondition | Gas station G exists, user has no account |  
| Post condition | G.F.currentPrice = G.F.newPrice |
| Nominal Scenario | User selects gas station G on the map, select fuel type F, update price |
| Variants | User selects gas station G on the map, add fuel type F, add new price |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Show gas stations on the map with GPS

| Actors Involved | User, Database, Google Maps APIs |

| Precondition | At least one gas station exists, user has no account |
| Nominal Scenario | User opens the map section, select location, retrieves gas stations on the map for the area displayed on the screen |
| Variants | User opens the map section, gets geolocalized with GPS that has been activated, retrieves gas stations on the map for the area displayed on the screen |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Filter shown gas stations based on price, fuel and distance

| Actors Involved | User, Database, Google Maps APIs |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
