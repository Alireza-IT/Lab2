# Stories and personas

Luca works for a famous delivery company, and it is charge of driving the van to deliver the items in the city of Milan and its neighboring. Different times a week Luca finds himself to be short of fuel when travelling from a place to another one, and sometimes it is not so easy to find the nearest gas station, and, even if it's right before his eyes, not always it has competitive prices. Anyway usually Luca tries to look for a more convenient place, but after some minutes of searching he decides that he is wasting his time that could be used to deliver more items, so he often ends up paying for expensive fuel.

Luca signals his inconvenient to the company and finds out that other colleagues eperience the same problem. 

He realizes that the solution would be to create a channel or an application that allows users to find the closest gas station and compare their prices, so that he and his colleagues do not need to anticipate too much money and the company can start saving on a bigger scale. Moreover, as this is a common problem, Luca also thinks that maybe every driver can update the information related to a particular gas station, so that people in a similar situation could access updated data.
