# Abstract

EZGas application is an application to find the nearest gas station with the best price and also comparing them by some characteristics like price. This application has two types of users. One is with authentication in order to have some privileges, which is an Administrator and the other one, without those privileges, which is a general user. For having some special offers to loyal customers there is a need to have a login system and customer management. The loyalty is based on the number of feedbacks and also getting noticed by other people to those feedbacks. This shows how much feedback is valuable. 
Administrators in this system should update gas prices periodically for instance on a daily base. For accomplishing that he/she should check changes among the prices. He/She can use some systems to monitor the changes in gas prices. The administrator is also able to guide the user who is asking or help or for advertising some promotions.

# Stories and personas
Alice works in an office and when he wants to go to his office he uses his car. For a better experience, he uses some applications like ways or Google map to find the best path to work. For him, it is so useful to find gas stations in his path to work. Because he does not want to change his path so much and consume more fuel for that. Another advantage of finding a proper gas station is loyalty. He can get a special discount using his customer's cards if he is a loyal customer of a special company.

Bob is traveling in his car to a new place and does not know exactly the places and the prices of the gas in the new place. By searching on google map he just finds the place of gas stations and no more data are available about the gas price and also the people's feedback in that gas station. He fills the car using an oil company and he thinks he paid a lot for that he needs to tell the other people not to use that gas station because of that. 

persona1: Female, middle age, high income with a car not married
persona2: Male, Married , low or middle income
