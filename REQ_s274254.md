<!-- Goal of this lab is to practice the techniques to formalize the requirements of a software product.
Consider the EZGas application:
EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Abstract

Drivers do not always know what is the best gas station to go to, this is especially true when they are in a new neighborhood or city. They find themselves looking up for the closest gas station on the internet, not always knowing which one has the best price.

A company wants to realize a crowdsourcing service that allows users to both collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
and locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice. This application is meant to be used by any user that wants do search for the closest and most convenient gas station nearby. Whenever a customer visits the gas station, he can also update the service with up-to-date information.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| User     |Uses the application to look for gas stations and also updates the information on it| 
| Developer        |Develops the functionality of the applicaiton|

# Stories and personas

Mario is a taxi driver and he works in Rome. Being Rome such a big and chaotic city, he often struggles in remembering which is the closest gas station to his position, and even after finding a gas station after going around for a while, he often realizes that it has not the most convenient price he could have found in the neighborhood. Tired of searching and needful of heading back to his work, Mario pays that gas price anyway.
John really likes his work, but searching for gas stations can become frustrating, time consuming and expensive. 

John would like to have a simple way to look for gas stations in the surroundings and find the best one in terms of proximity and cost. He would also like to know the price for the exact type of fuel he needs. 

Additionaly, John would like to be able to look for specific gas stations he has already been to, by searching them by name, this is because with time he has become familiar with them and he would like to know if the prices there are still convenient.

For John it is not a problem to update others when he finds out new information about a gas station, he would like to help other drivers and tell them if a new gas station has just opened, or an old one has been dismissed. He would also like to share the information about the price he paid when refilling his taxi.
