# Abstract

Many drivers in the world would like to know prices of fuels in advance before going to a gas station, so they can choose the cheaper. Other want to know simply the closer to their position, so a map is needed.

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description |
|------------------|:-----------:|
| Users | Use the application to search gas station around their position and update their price |
| Developers | Can use the application. They are impacted in case the product to be developed is with poorly written requirements |

| User | GUI | Screen, touchscreen |
| Map System | API | Internet |
| GPS System | API | GPS satellites |

# Stories and personas

Charlie is a **truck driver** who does not care about the price but would like to find the gas stations easily, in order to organize his journey.

Oscar is a **father** of three children, he would like to find the nearest and cheapest stations. It would be important to him that the prices are updated recently.

Mike is a **tourist**, he recently arrived in a city and would like to find gas stations. It is important for him that the application is easy to use, he does not want to take time to learn its functions.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

| ID       | Description  |
|----------|:------------:| 
|  FR1     | Record that a user or guest has searched for nearest gas stations |
|  FR2     | Record that a user has updated the price of a gas station |
|  FR3     | View the prices of each gas stations on the maps |
|  FR4     | Manage accounts and guests |
|  FR5     | Manage different types and brands of gas stations |


## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126) | Description | Refers to |
|-----------|:-----------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|----------:|
|  NFR1     | Usability | Application should be used without download every time the entire databse | All FR |
|  NFR2     | Performance | All functions should complete in < 1 sec | All FR |
|  NFR3     | Portability | The application runs on Android and IOS | All FR |
|  NFR4     | Localisation | Decimal numbers use . (dot) as decimal separator ||
