# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:

- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice

| User | Uses the web application directly. Interested in collecting prices of fuel and lacating gas stations in an area. | 
| Administrator | Manages the DBMSs and the servers | 
| Developer | Develops and maintains the software product |

# Stories and personas

Andrea, the random traveller. He is a 30 years old technician.  He travels a lot for business purposes and drives a powerful car with high fuel consumption, so he often needs to find a gas station to refuel. Typically, he hopes to find along the way a gas station which applies economic prices.

Wherever he is,  he would like to use his smartphone and get a chance to find quickly the cheapest  gas station to refuel,  exploiting his  position in the map.

Paola, the regular commuter.  She is a very efficient engineer who drives 100 Km down the same road every day to go to work. Many gas stations are available along the way and Paola pays attention to check price changes. She usually remembers the gas station which is applying the best price.

She would like to collect the set of gas stations to which she is interested and receive a daily report with prices update and potentially to be able to contribute to update prices. 

Greta, the gas station manager.  She is 50 years old and she likes to move with the times. She is a hard worker, but she realized that she would work better if people knew she usually applies cheap prices.

She needs an easy way  to drive traffic to her gas station. She could also be able to set and publish the prices she is applying.
