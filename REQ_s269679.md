# Abstract
A group of friends who are used to travel almost every day because of their job and because during the weekend they spend time with their family and friends doing sightseeing and walking in the nature, have a Whatsapp group in which they are used to signal to the other the price of the Gas station in which they fuel up, so that the other member of the group can refuel in the station with the lower price.

Since the more people there are in the group, the more price reports there are, it could be possible to have the price of all the gas stations in the city, in this way, it is much more likely to refuel in the gas station with the lower price in the city. Thatâ€™s why some member of this group, who are employers in an IT company, decided to set up a mobile crowdsourcing application, which could allow the users collect the price of the gas stations, and to find, among the gas station closer to him, the one which has the lower price. 

Since anyone could be able the change the prices, all the modifications provided by the users, have to be inspected by a group of moderators. 
All the modifications provided by users who can demonstrate to be the owner of the gas stations are automatically approved.
