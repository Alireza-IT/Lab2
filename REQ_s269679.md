# Abstract
A group of friends are used to travel almost every day because of their job and because during the weekend they spend time with their family and friends doing sightseeing and walking in the nature and so on. They have a Whatsapp group in which they signal to the others the prices of the Gas station in which they fuel up, so that the other members of the group can refuel in the station with the lower price.

Since the more people there are in the group, the more price reports there are, it could be possible to have the price of all the gas stations in the city, in this way, it is much more likely to refuel in the gas station with the lower price in the city. However, doing it with a Whatsapp group would be a mess, either because there would be too much messages and finding the lower prices among them would be really difficult, moreover people who are interested to this kind of service are not able to freely join the group. Thatâ€™s why some member of this group, who are employers in an IT company, decided to set up a mobile crowdsourcing application, which could allow the users to collect the price of the gas stations, and to find, among them the one which is closer and with the lower prices. 

Since anyone could be able to change the prices, all the modifications provided by the end users, have to be inspected by a group of moderators. 
The gas station owners are able to provide some proof in order to take the control of the price list of their gas station, all the modifications provided by an owner are automatically approved, moreover the owner is able to accept or reject the modifications provided by the other users for their gas station.
